# Overview
HSMCPP is a C++ library providing implementation of state machine design pattern. It allows you to easily add hierarchical (HSM) or finite state machine (FSM) to your project. Main motivation behind creating it was lack of suitable alternatives which do not require usage of large frameworks (often commercial). And even they couldn't satisfy project needs that I usually have to deal with. This is in no way a "silver bullet" library, but it might be useful for you when dealing with RTOS systems, multi-threading or event driven applications.

It's also applicable for single threaded and synchronous applications, but it might not be the most efficient option.

If you are not familiar with HSM/FSM and which problems they can solve in your code, I recommend reading:
- [Welcome to the world of Statecharts](https://statecharts.dev)
- [Introduction to Hierarchical State Machines](https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/how-to/introduction-hierarchical-state-machines)
- [Hierarchical Finite State Machine for AI Acting Engine](https://towardsdatascience.com/hierarchical-finite-state-machine-for-ai-acting-engine-9b24efc66f2)

# Key Features

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/igor-krechetov/hsmcpp.git
cd ./hsmcpp
./build.sh
cd ./build
make install
```
By default it will build all included components, tests and examples. You can disable any of them using cmake build flags. For example you probably will not have glib or glibmm libraries available on Windows so you might want to exclude them.

See [detailed instructions in documentation](https://hsmcpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/getting-started.html#building-the-library).

# Creating a simple State Machine
HSM structure:

![Hello Wolrd HSM](https://hsmcpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/images/00_helloworld.png)

Implementation using HsmEventDispatcherSTD:
```C++
#include <chrono>
#include <thread>
#include <hsmcpp/hsm.hpp>
#include <hsmcpp/HsmEventDispatcherSTD.hpp>

enum class States
{
    OFF,
    ON
};

enum class Events
{
    SWITCH
};

int main(const int argc, const char**argv)
{
    std::shared_ptr<hsmcpp::HsmEventDispatcherSTD> dispatcher = hsmcpp::HsmEventDispatcherSTD::create();
    hsmcpp::HierarchicalStateMachine<States, Events> hsm(States::OFF);

    hsm.initialize(dispatcher);

    hsm.registerState(States::OFF, [&hsm](const VariantList_t& args)
    {
        printf("Off\n");
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000));
        hsm.transition(Events::SWITCH);
    });
    hsm.registerState(States::ON, [&hsm](const VariantList_t& args)
    {
        printf("On\n");
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000));
        hsm.transition(Events::SWITCH);
    });

    hsm.registerTransition(States::OFF, States::ON, Events::SWITCH);
    hsm.registerTransition(States::ON, States::OFF, Events::SWITCH);

    hsm.transition(Events::SWITCH);

    dispatcher->join();

    return 0;
}
```
